%description
This is a basic version of pacman. I've tried to concentrate on the essentials
of the game for now, which means a lot of the original features are absent (ie
no scores, no fruit, no special items, no lives). When all the pills have been 
cleared from a level, the difficulty level is notched up, and a new level is
generated. If you collide with a ghost, all the pills are replaced, and you
restart the current level from scratch. A new feature just added is the
presence of large red pills that for a short time turn the ghosts grey and let
you eat them.
